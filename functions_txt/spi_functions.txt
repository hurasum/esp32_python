spi.deinit()

Deinitialize the SPI object, free all used resources.

spi.read(len [,val])

Read len bytes from SPI device.
Returns the string of read bytes.
If the optional val argument is given, outputs val byte on mosi during read (if duplex mode is used).

spi.readinto(buf [,val])

Read bytes from SPI device into buffer object buf. Length of buf bytes are read.
If the optional val argument is given, outputs val byte on mosi during read (if duplex mode is used).

spi.readfrom_mem(address, length [,addrlen])

Writes address to the spi device and reads length bytes.
The number of the address bytes to write is determined from the address value (1 byte for 0-255, 2 bytes for 256-65535, ...).
The number of address bytes to be written can also be set by the optional argument addrlen (1-4).
Returns the string of read bytes.

spi.write(buf)

Write bytes from buffer object buf to the SPI device.
Returns True on success, False ion error

spi.write_readinto(wr_buf, rd_buf)

Write bytes from buffer object wr_buf to the SPI device and reads from SPI device into buffer object rd_buf.
The lenghts of wr_buf and rd_buf can be different.
In fullduplex mode write and read are simultaneous. In halfduplex mode the data are first written to the device, then read from it.
Returns True on success, False ion error

spi.select()

Activates the CS pin if it was configured when the spi object was created.

spi.deselect()

Deactivates the CS pin if it was configured when the spi object was created.
