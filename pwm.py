"""
PWM typing class
This class includes PWM support using ESP32 LEDC peripheral


Features

    up to 8 pwm channels can be used
    4 pwm timers are available, multiple channels can use the same timer
    all pwm channels using the same timer have the same frequency, but can have different duty cycles
    maximum pwm frequency is 40 MHz
    pwm duty resolution can be 1-15 bits and is automatically set to maximum value for requested frequency.
    The frequency and the duty resolution are interdependent. The higher the PWM frequency, the lower duty resolution is available and vice versa.
