"""
ADC typing class



ESP32 integrates two 12-bit SAR (Successive Approximation Register) ADCs (Analog to Digital Converters) and supports measurements on 18 channels (analog enabled pins).
The ADC driver API supports:

ADC1 (8 channels, attached to GPIOs 32 - 39)
ADC2 (10 channels, attached to GPIOs 0, 2, 4, 12 - 15 and 25 - 27).

However, thereâ€™re some restrictions for the application to use ADC2:

The application can use ADC2 only when Wi-Fi driver is not started, since the ADC is also used by the Wi-Fi driver, which has higher priority.
Some of the ADC2 pins are used as strapping pins (GPIO 0, 2, 15), so they cannot be used freely.
For examples, for official Develop Kits:
ESP32 Core Board V2 / ESP32 DevKitC: GPIO 0 cannot be used due to external auto program circuits.
ESP-WROVER-KIT V3: GPIO 0, 2, 4 and 15 cannot be used due to external connections for different purposes.


This class includes full support for using ESP32 ADC peripheral.
Functions are added to set the attenuation and to calibrate the ADC.

ESP32 ADC input voltage range depends on attenuation setting:
Attenuation 	Voltage range
0 dB 	1.1 V
2.5 dB 	1.5 V
6 dB 	2.2 V
11 dB 	3.9 V

Due to ADC characteristics, most accurate results are obtained within the following approximate voltage ranges:

0 dB attenuaton (ATTN_0DB) between 100 and 950mV
2.5 dB attenuation (ATTN_2_5DB) between 100 and 1250mV
6 dB attenuation (ATTN_6DB) between 150 to 1750mV
11 dB attenuation (ATTN_11DB) between 150 to 2450mV


Note: Using ADC2 works, but as support for ADC2 in esp-idf is not fully functional, some error logs may br printed while using ADC2.
